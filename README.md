# Pac-Man

This game uses ncurses library to display it's graphics.
It's a university project I have done which includes 3 implementations:
- threads
- processes
- System V (not working)

## Installation

You will need to install ncurses library, then

```bash
make
```

To remove compiled files

```bash
make clean
```

Tested on Manjaro Linux (v18.0.4) with ncurses and lib32-ncurses packages installed.

## Usage

To start for example the thread version:

```bash
./esercizio2/pacman
```

Use arrows to move.
